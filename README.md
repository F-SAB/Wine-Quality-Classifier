# Introduction
This project aims to predict the quality of wines based on their chemical characteristics using machine learning algorithms. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best possible classification accuracy.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality and contains information on various chemical properties of wines along with their quality ratings.

# Features
The dataset includes the following features:

fixed acidity
volatile acidity
citric acid
residual sugar
chlorides
free sulfur dioxide
total sulfur dioxide
density
pH
sulphates
alcohol
type (categorical)
quality (target variable)

# Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Handle missing values using mean imputation.
2. Handled Class Imbalance using SMOTE.
3. Visualize distributions and relationships among variables.
4. Identify outliers and decide on handling them.
5. Explore correlations between features and the target variable (quality).

# Model Building
Train several machine learning models:
  1. Logistic Regression
  2. Decision Tree Classifier
  3. Random Forest Classifier
  4. Extra Trees Classifier

# Evaluation Metrics
Evaluate model performance using the following metrics:
  1. Accuracy
  2. Precision
  3. Recall
  4. F1-score
     
# Hyperparameter Tuning
1. Used techniques like Randomized Search to optimize model hyperparameters.
2. Improve model performance by fine-tuning parameters that affect model learning.

# Insights and Observations:

*Handling Missing Values:* Effectively handled missing values by imputing them with the mean of respective columns, ensuring the dataset was complete for analysis.

*Handling Class Imbalance:* Balanced the class distribution of wine quality ratings using SMOTE, which is crucial for training models that can predict all classes effectively.

*Model Selection and Tuning:* Explored multiple classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees) and found that Extra Trees performed the best after tuning. This highlights the importance of experimenting with different algorithms and tuning parameters to achieve optimal results.

*Model Performance:* Both the original and tuned models perform quite well, with the tuned model showing a slight improvement across all metrics. This indicates that hyperparameter tuning effectively optimized the model for better performance.

*Cross-validation:* Cross-validation scores for the tuned model range between 83.13% and 85.31%, with a mean score of approximately 83.88%. This suggests that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data, indicating robustness.
